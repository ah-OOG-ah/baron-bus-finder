# baron-bus-finder

This repo hosts the server and website behind Franciscan University's Baron Bus tracker.
Website files are in `./page/`, server file is `./server.js`.

### To run
Install NodeJS; this was tested against NodeJS v21.1.0, but it probably works with the latest and LTS versions as of 11/11/2023.
Running `node server.js` will start a server at http://localhost:3000 for testing.
